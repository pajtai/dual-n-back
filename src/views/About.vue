  <div class="about">
    <p>This game is based off of the dual n-back test. This type of game has <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/10/23/558767704/in-memory-training-smackdown-one-method-dominates">
      been shown to help attention and memory
    </a>. It's called "dual" because you have to remember both position and number. It's called n-back because you have to
      remember these things n steps back.</p>
    <p>The goal is to remember the position and number of boxes that are NBack steps back in history. For example if the
      NBack level is 2 and the number being shown is 5, the previous number was 0, and the one before that was 5, you should
      hit the right arrow.</p>
    <p>You will get a point for each position or color entered correctly. You will lose a point for each position or number
      you miss.</p>
